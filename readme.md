# Pet Project - TodoMVC

Just imagine you've been hired to work on the (hypothetical) Kreios TodoMVC project,
a project whose purpose is to create a cheap knock-off of the more popular
Wunderlist (https://www.wunderlist.com/) application.

__Core features:__
* Manage a list of todo items
* Mark items as complete
* Clear (i.e. forget about) completed items
* Filter items by status

The pre-sales team has already built a small prototype of the core application, which
you are now supposed to extend into the full-fledged application. That prototype is just
a bit of JavaScript, HTML and CSS - no back-end what-so-ever!

## How to get started ##
* Install Node.js version 5.7.0
* Install IntelliJ (optional)
* Use `npm install` to install the projects dependencies
* Use `npm test` to run the projects test suite
* Create a personal fork of the official "Pet Store" git repository on the [Kreios Bitbucket server](https://bitbucket.kreios.lu)

## Tasks

The following table gives the list of tasks we'd like you to work on, listed in
order of priority. Each task should be implemented on a dedicated feature branch (following the
[git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching model) for which you then create a pull request on the Kreios Bitbucket server.
